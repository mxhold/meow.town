MEOW TOWN Code of Conduct
=========================
MEOW TOWN is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all MEOW TOWN spaces, including public channels,
private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates
this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the
discretion of the administrators, who are currently:

Harrassment includes:
---------------------
  - Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
    orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical
    appearance, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin,
    nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or
    other identity marker, including anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and
    anti-Blackness

  - Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices,
    including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs,
    and employment

  - Questioning or challenging someone’s stated self-identity or chosen labels,
    even if they conflict with your own views, for example, discussions about bi
    vs pan, trans vs trans*, or whether grey/demisexual people are asexual, even
    if well-intentioned

  - Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names

  - Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re
    not appropriate

  - Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions
    like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop

  - Threats of violence

  - Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a
    person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm

  - Deliberate intimidation

  - Stalking or following

  - Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for
    harassment purposes

  - Sustained disruption of discussion

  - Unwelcome sexual attention

  - Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
    inappropriate levels of intimacy with others

  - Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease

  - Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their
    consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional
    abuse

  - Publication of non-harassing private communication

Jokes that resemble the above, such as ‘hipster racism’, still count as
harassment even if meant satirically or ironically

MEOW TOWN prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s
comfort. The administrators will not act on complaints regarding:

  - “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and 
    “cisphobia”

  - Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,”
    or “I’m not discussing this with you.”

  - Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial

  - Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or
    assumptions


Reporting
---------
If you are being harassed by a member of MEOW TOWN, notice that someone else
is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators
by email. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse
themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to MEOW TOWN spaces, but if you are being
harassed by a member of MEOW TOWN outside our spaces, we still want to know
about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by MEOW TOWN
members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment
outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The
abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from MEOW TOWN based on
their past behavior, including behavior outside MEOW TOWN spaces and
behavior towards people who are not in MEOW TOWN.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to
reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to
silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims
of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve
received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if
we believe that doing so will increase the safety of MEOW TOWN members or
the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their
affirmative consent.


Consequences
------------
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any
action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all MEOW TOWN
spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other MEOW TOWN
members or the general public.
