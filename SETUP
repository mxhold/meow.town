This is a log of how meow.town was set up, just in case we have to do this
again.

Francisco 2 region with 512 MB memory and 20 GB SSD.

sudo sysrc apache24_enable=yes
sudo service apache24 start

cp {files,}/usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf

Make a deployer user and then symlink the release directory to /www
sudo ln -s /home/deployer/releases/current /www

Adding users

cp {files,}/etc/adduser.conf
cp {files,}/etc/adduser.msg

adduser # then follow prompts

Add their SSH public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:
mkdir /home/newuser
mkdir .ssh
vim .ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown -R newuser .ssh

For the first/main user, add them as an alias for root like:
root: max
